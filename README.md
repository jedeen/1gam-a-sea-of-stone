# A Sea of Stone
*A game for one or more players*

You are wandering through an endless place dedicated to those who are gone.

Each player writes down the name of someone whose death impacted them, whose life changed them.

Each player recounts a memory of the person whose name they inscribed, and how that memory feels to them.

Other players remain silent during the recounting.

Once all players have told their stories, the process can begin again, if all players wish it to. If not, return to shore.
